Background:

Forest fires present a particular challenge in land management.  The economic impact of these fires can be severe, but 	supression of fires can result in long-term negative effects on forest ecosystems, as well as create the potential for more damaging fires.  Efforts to manage these effects are hampered by a lack of data about forest ecosystems and by the need to improve understanding of large-scale forest disturbances[Maclean, Flores].  

One promising avenue for the development of forest land management strategies are geostatistical surveys, including geostatistical soil analysis.  Geostatistical methods of soil analysis have been in use for nearly six decades.  The aim of these techniques is to use a small number of soil samples from discrete points spread out across a geographical area to interpolate information about areas between these points.  This form of analysis is useful in implementing precision agriculture and in conducting environmental assessments [Mason, Olea. USDA].

Geostastical forest surveys face several main obstacles.  Firstly, the cost of taking samples distributed across a wide geographic area is often prohibitive.  The sampling locations must neccesarily include remote regions, and measurements at multiple points in time are recommended [USDA].  Secondly, the forest must be surveyed before a fire[Flores], so effective surveys need to cover very large areas.  Finally, knowledge about a forest system is fundamentally constrained by the number of sampling locations [Olea].  These factors together limit the effectiveness of each survey for a given cost, reducing the utility of an otherwise plausible methodology for investigation.

These costs can all be reduced by the introduction of an automated system that can collect samples and perform measurements [Sadowsky].  Automated systems thus far have been limited to those which require direct human implementation at the location of the soil sample.  In this paper, we present the Metropolitain State University of Denver Autonomous Soil Investigator, a proof-of-concept robotic system which could navigate a forest landscape and perform the collection of soil samples.  This robotic system can function autonomously and costs less that $2000 in raw materials.  The development and implementation of this robotic system has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of sampling efforts while also improving the geographic density and frequency of data collection, providing forest researches with a powerful avenue for understanding and managing forest fires.
